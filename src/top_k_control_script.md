# Top K: Vocabulary Control for Precise AI Responses: 3-Minute Video Script

**Duration**: ~3 minutes  
**Target Audience**: AI developers, prompt engineers, and content creators using LLMs  
**Goal**: Explain Top K concept, demonstrate vocabulary control benefits, and show when to use different Top K values with practical examples

---

## Opening Hook (0:00 - 0:25)

**[Screen: Two AI responses to "Write code to sort data" - one clean, one with random words mixed in]**

**Narrator**: "One AI writes clean code with proper syntax. The other randomly includes words like 'beautiful,' 'journey,' and 'democracy' in a sorting function. Same model, same prompt - the difference? Top K vocabulary control. When you don't limit vocabulary, AI can choose ANY word, including completely inappropriate ones."

**[Animation showing: Unlimited vocabulary → 50,000 possible words including "unicorn" in code vs. Top K=25 → Only relevant programming terms]**

**Narrator**: "Top K isn't just another parameter - it's your vocabulary bouncer, keeping irrelevant words out of your AI responses."

---

## Top K: The Vocabulary Filter (0:25 - 1:05)

**[Screen: Visual representation of Top K filtering process]**

**Narrator**: "Top K is brilliantly simple: at each step, only consider the K most probable words. Everything else is off-limits."

**[Animation showing token selection process:]**

**For "The algorithm is very..."**
- **All tokens**: efficient (20%), complex (15%), fast (10%), beautiful (0.1%), purple (0.01%), zebra (0.001%)
- **Top K=3**: Only considers [efficient, complex, fast]
- **Result**: Relevant technical vocabulary only

**Narrator**: "Notice what we filtered out - 'beautiful' might work poetically, but for technical writing, it's vocabulary noise. 'Purple' and 'zebra' are just random distractions."

**[Code demonstration showing VaultMind's TopKManager:]**

```python
# Code generation needs focused vocabulary
code_params = manager.get_optimal_top_k(TaskType.CODE_GENERATION)
# Result: top_k=25 - only programming-relevant words

# Creative writing allows unlimited vocabulary  
creative_params = manager.get_optimal_top_k(TaskType.CREATIVE_WRITING)
# Result: top_k=None - access to all words including metaphors
```

**Narrator**: "VaultMind automatically sets Top K based on your task. Code generation gets 25 words max. Creative writing gets unlimited access. The system knows what vocabulary makes sense."

## The Vocabulary Sweet Spots (1:05 - 1:50)

**[Screen: Dashboard showing VaultMind's task-specific Top K configurations]**

**Narrator**: "Here's what we've learned through extensive testing: different tasks need radically different vocabulary constraints."

**[Visual chart showing optimal Top K values:]**

**Ultra-Focused (Top K = 20-30):**
- **Code Generation**: Only programming keywords and syntax
- **Medical Documentation**: Only precise medical terminology
- **Legal Writing**: Only exact legal language

**Focused (Top K = 40-60):**
- **Data Analysis**: Technical terms with some explanation flexibility
- **Factual Extraction**: Precise but allows contextual variety

**Balanced (Top K = 100-150):**
- **Business Communication**: Professional but natural language
- **General Conversation**: Conversational variety without randomness

**Unlimited (No Top K):**
- **Creative Writing**: Access to metaphors, artistic language, unique expressions
- **Brainstorming**: Unexpected word combinations for novel ideas

**[Live demo showing task detection:]**

**Narrator**: "VaultMind automatically detects your task type and sets appropriate limits. Ask for code? You get technical vocabulary only. Request a story? Full creative vocabulary opens up."

---

## Vocabulary Control in Action (1:50 - 2:30)

**[Screen: Live comparison of responses with different Top K values]**

**Narrator**: "Watch vocabulary control prevent quality disasters. Same prompt: 'Explain machine learning algorithms.'"

**[Side-by-side comparison:]**

**No Top K Control:**
"Machine learning algorithms are like magical unicorns dancing through rainbow forests of data, where each sparkly decision tree whispers secrets to the neural butterflies..."

**Top K = 50 (Focused):**
"Machine learning algorithms are computational methods that identify patterns in data through iterative training processes, using techniques like decision trees, neural networks, and statistical modeling..."

**[Code showing VaultMind's vocabulary analysis:]**

```python
analysis = manager.analyze_vocabulary_effectiveness(
    response_text="magical unicorns dancing through rainbow forests...",
    task_type=TaskType.TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION,
    used_top_k=None
)

# Result: Low domain alignment, suggests top_k=35 for technical accuracy
```

**Narrator**: "VaultMind's vocabulary analyzer catches when your Top K settings don't match your task. It literally tells you 'this vocabulary is inappropriate for technical writing - try Top K = 35 instead.'"

---

## Domain-Specific Intelligence (2:30 - 2:55)

**[Screen: Domain-specific vocabulary optimization examples]**

**Narrator**: "But VaultMind goes deeper than just task types - it optimizes for domain-specific vocabulary needs."

**[Examples showing domain optimization:]**

**Medical Domain + Analysis Task:**
- **Top K = 30**: Only medical terminology, drug names, anatomical terms
- **Filters out**: Casual language, metaphors, non-medical vocabulary

**Business Domain + Communication Task:**
- **Top K = 80**: Professional language, business terminology, appropriate formality
- **Maintains**: Corporate tone while allowing natural expression

**Creative Domain + Writing Task:**
- **No Top K**: Full vocabulary including archaic words, poetic language, invented terms
- **Enables**: Unique voice, artistic expression, literary devices

**[Code showing domain integration:]**

```python
# Medical analysis gets ultra-focused vocabulary
medical_params = manager.get_complete_sampling_parameters(
    task_type=TaskType.ANALYSIS,
    domain=Domain.MEDICAL
)
# Result: top_k=30, highly constrained for precision

# Creative writing gets unlimited vocabulary
creative_params = manager.get_complete_sampling_parameters(
    task_type=TaskType.CREATIVE_WRITING, 
    domain=Domain.CREATIVE
)
# Result: top_k=None, maximum creative expression
```

**Narrator**: "The system understands that medical analysis needs surgical precision in language, while creative writing needs the full spectrum of human expression."

## Closing & Impact (2:55 - 3:00)

**[Screen: Before/after quality comparison showing vocabulary improvement]**

**Narrator**: "Top K transforms AI from a vocabulary lottery into a precision instrument. The right vocabulary constraints mean your AI sounds professional in business, technical in code, and creative in stories - automatically."

**[Key takeaways displayed:]**
- **Top K = Vocabulary Bouncer**: Filters out inappropriate words
- **Task-Specific Optimization**: Different tasks need different vocabulary limits  
- **Domain Intelligence**: Medical ≠ Creative ≠ Business vocabulary needs
- **Quality Control**: Prevents random/inappropriate word selection
