# Dynamic Prompting: Context-Aware AI That Learns You: 3-Minute Video Script

**Duration**: ~3 minutes  
**Target Audience**: AI practitioners, knowledge workers, and productivity enthusiasts  
**Goal**: Explain dynamic prompting, context-aware AI, and adaptive prompt strategies that evolve with user patterns

---

## Opening Hook (0:00 - 0:25)

**[Screen: Split view showing static prompt vs dynamic prompt adapting in real-time]**

**Narrator**: "What if your AI assistant actually learned how you work? Not just what you ask, but when you ask it, what your vault looks like, and how you prefer your insights delivered? That's dynamic prompting - AI that adapts to you instead of forcing you to adapt to it."

**[Animation showing: User Context + Vault Patterns + Real-time Cues → Personalized AI Response]**

**Narrator**: "Today I'll show you VaultMind's dynamic prompting system - AI that gets smarter about YOU every time you use it."

## The Context-Aware Revolution (0:25 - 1:10)

**[Screen: Dashboard showing user profile building in real-time]**

**Narrator**: "Traditional AI treats every user the same. Static prompts, generic responses. But your vault tells a story about how you think, when you're productive, and what insights you value most."

**[Visual showing vault analysis components:]**
- **Vault Profile**: "150 journal entries, prefers morning analysis, technical writing style"
- **User Patterns**: "Loves action items, rates detailed analysis highly"  
- **Live Context**: "Monday morning, active project: VaultMind, goal: finish implementation"

**[Code demonstration showing VaultProfile and ContextAnalyzer]**

**Narrator**: "VaultMind's ContextAnalyzer examines your vault characteristics - note types, writing patterns, activity times, even your link density. It builds a comprehensive profile of how you work with knowledge."

**[Screen showing real profile data]**

**Narrator**: "Are you a morning person who writes technical notes? Evening reflector with emotional depth? The system learns and adapts its analysis style accordingly."

## Adaptation Strategies in Action (1:10 - 1:55)

**[Screen: Live demo of DynamicPromptBuilder with different strategies]**

**Narrator**: "Here's where it gets powerful. VaultMind uses six adaptation strategies that work together:"

**[Animation showing strategies applying in sequence:]**

1. **Progressive Learning**: "Remembers what worked before - 'User loved detailed sentiment analysis'"
2. **Pattern Matching**: "Matches your vault style - 'Technical writer needs structured output'"  
3. **Contextual Weighting**: "Considers current context - 'Monday morning = action-focused'"
4. **Feedback Loop**: "Learns from ratings - 'Adjust depth based on recent 5-star feedback'"
5. **Semantic Clustering**: "Connects to your themes - 'Relates to productivity and AI clusters'"
6. **Temporal Evolution**: "Time-aware adaptation - 'Evening = reflective analysis mode'"

**[Live code execution showing strategy selection]**

**Narrator**: "Watch this: same note, different contexts. Morning analysis focuses on action items. Evening analysis emphasizes reflection and synthesis. The AI literally thinks differently based on when and how you work."

## Real-World Personalization (1:55 - 2:35)

**[Screen: Before/after comparison of generic vs personalized prompts]**

**Narrator**: "Let's see real personalization in action. Here's a weekly review note analyzed with different user profiles:"

**[Split screen showing three different users:]**

**Beginner User**: 
- Generic: "Analyze this content"
- Dynamic: "Provide clear explanations with step-by-step reasoning. Consider this matches your journal writing style and morning productivity pattern."

**Expert User**:
- Generic: "Analyze this content" 
- Dynamic: "Apply advanced analytical techniques focusing on sophisticated patterns. Match your technical writing density and high-volume note production style."

**Project Manager**:
- Generic: "Analyze this content"
- Dynamic: "Focus on actionable outcomes aligned with active VaultMind project. Structure for deliverables matching your meeting-heavy workflow and action-oriented preferences."

**[Code showing personalization elements being applied]**

**Narrator**: "Same content, completely different analysis approaches. The AI becomes YOUR AI."

## The Learning Loop (2:35 - 2:55)

**[Screen: Feedback loop visualization showing improvement over time]**

**Narrator**: "The magic happens in the learning loop. Every interaction teaches the system more about your preferences."

**[Animation showing improvement cycle:]**
- **User rates analysis** → **System learns pattern** → **Updates adaptation rules** → **Better next analysis**

**[Graph showing confidence scores improving over time]**

**Narrator**: "VaultMind tracks confidence scores - how sure it is about personalizing for you. More usage equals better adaptation. The system literally gets smarter about your specific needs."

**[Code showing learning_memory and feedback processing]**

**Narrator**: "Rate an analysis highly? The system remembers that approach. Prefer bullet points over paragraphs? It learns your format preferences. Over time, it becomes like having a personal analyst who knows exactly how you think."

---

## Closing & Future Vision (2:55 - 3:00)

**[Screen: Vision of fully personalized AI workspace]**

**Narrator**: "Dynamic prompting isn't just about better AI responses - it's about AI that evolves with you. As your vault grows and your needs change, your AI assistant adapts alongside you."

**[Call-to-action with key benefits displayed]**

**Narrator**: "VaultMind's dynamic prompting: Context-aware, personally adaptive, continuously learning AI that truly understands how you work with knowledge."

**[End screen: "VaultMind: AI That Learns You"]**
