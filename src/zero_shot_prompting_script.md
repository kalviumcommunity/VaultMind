# Zero-Shot Prompting for Note Analysis: 3-Minute Video Script

**Duration**: ~3 minutes  
**Target Audience**: Developers and AI practitioners interested in prompt engineering  
**Goal**: Explain zero-shot prompting and demonstrate VaultMind's implementation

---

## Opening Hook (0:00 - 0:20)

**[Screen: Code editor with various note types displayed]**

**Narrator**: "What if I told you that AI could analyze any type of note - journal entries, meeting minutes, research papers - without ever seeing an example of how to do it? That's the power of zero-shot prompting, and today I'll show you how we implemented it in VaultMind."

## What is Zero-Shot Prompting? (0:20 - 1:00)

**[Screen: Split view - traditional ML vs zero-shot approach]**

**Narrator**: "Traditional machine learning needs training examples. Want to classify emails? You need thousands of labeled emails. Want to analyze sentiment? You need sentiment-labeled data."

**[Animation showing training data requirements]**

**Narrator**: "But zero-shot prompting is different. Instead of examples, we give the AI a clear task description and let its pre-trained knowledge do the work. No training data. No fine-tuning. Just intelligent task description."

**[Screen: Simple diagram showing: Task Description → AI Model → Analysis Result]**

**Narrator**: "The key is in how we structure our prompts. We need to be crystal clear about what we want the AI to do."

## VaultMind's RTFC Framework (1:00 - 1:40)

**[Screen: Code showing ZeroShotPrompt class]**

**Narrator**: "In VaultMind, we use a structured approach with four components:"

**[Animation highlighting each component as mentioned]**

1. **Task Description**: "Exactly what analysis to perform"
2. **Context Instructions**: "Background about the type of content" 
3. **Output Format**: "How to structure the results"
4. **Constraints**: "Guidelines for quality and focus"

**[Screen: Code example showing prompt building]**

```python
# Example from our implementation
ZeroShotPrompt(
    task_description="Extract the most important points and insights from the content",
    context_instructions="You are analyzing personal notes to identify core information",
    output_format="A numbered list of key points with brief explanations",
    constraints=["Focus on actionable insights", "Be specific with examples"]
)
```

**Narrator**: "This structure ensures our prompts are comprehensive yet focused."

## Live Demonstration (1:40 - 2:30)

**[Screen: Running the zero_shot_prompting.py demo]**

**Narrator**: "Let's see this in action. Here's our ZeroShotAnalyzer handling different note types without any training examples."

**[Code execution showing:]**

```python
# Analyzing a journal entry
analyzer = ZeroShotAnalyzer()
journal_note = NoteContent(
    title="Daily Reflection",
    content="Had a productive day... feeling confident...",
    note_type=NoteType.JOURNAL
)

# Zero-shot sentiment analysis
prompt = analyzer.analyze_note(journal_note, AnalysisTask.ANALYZE_SENTIMENT)
```

**[Screen: Generated prompt displayed]**

**Narrator**: "Notice how the system automatically adapts the prompt based on note type. For a journal entry, it includes context about personal reflection. For meeting notes, it focuses on action items and decisions."

**[Quick demo of different note types]**

**Narrator**: "The same analyzer handles research papers, meeting minutes, and project notes - all without specific training for each type."

## Key Benefits & Architecture (2:30 - 2:50)

**[Screen: Architecture diagram showing the analyzer components]**

**Narrator**: "Why is this powerful? Three key benefits:"

**[Animation showing benefits:]**

1. **Flexibility**: "Works with any note type immediately"
2. **No Training Data**: "Start analyzing notes from day one"
3. **Consistent Quality**: "Structured prompts ensure reliable results"

**[Screen: Code showing task suggestions feature]**

**Narrator**: "Our system even suggests appropriate analysis tasks based on content. Meeting notes get action item extraction, journals get sentiment analysis - all automatically."

## Closing & Next Steps (2:50 - 3:00)

**[Screen: GitHub repository or documentation link]**

**Narrator**: "Zero-shot prompting transforms how we handle diverse content types. In VaultMind, it means users get intelligent analysis without training delays or data requirements."

**[Call-to-action text displayed]**

**Narrator**: "Check out the full implementation in our repository, and see how zero-shot prompting can enhance your own AI applications."

## Technical Notes for Implementation

### Key Code Demonstrations to Show:

1. **ZeroShotAnalyzer initialization**: Show the clean, simple interface
2. **Prompt building process**: Demonstrate how task + context + format = effective prompt
3. **Multi-note type handling**: Same code, different note types
4. **Task suggestions**: Intelligent recommendations based on content

### Visual Elements:

- **Split screens** showing traditional ML vs zero-shot approach
- **Code highlighting** for key methods and classes
- **Live terminal output** showing the system working
- **Animated diagrams** for conceptual explanations

### Script Timing Breakdown:
- **Hook**: 20 seconds (grab attention)
- **Concept explanation**: 40 seconds (what is zero-shot)
- **Framework overview**: 40 seconds (our approach)
- **Live demo**: 50 seconds (seeing it work)
- **Benefits**: 20 seconds (why it matters)
- **Closing**: 10 seconds (call to action)

### Key Messages:
